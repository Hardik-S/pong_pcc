Pong for PCC

Summer internship application

Pong is one of the oldest computer games. This is my attempt at recreating it with a retro theme.
The game is self-explanatory and I have heavily annoted the code. 

Instructions on how to run the program: 
1. This was written in Java.
2. Eclipse IDE & Java Version 1.8.0 u211 were used.
3. After pulling the files, please simply run pongA to run the applet.
4. Running pongT runs the unit tests. 
5. Note: Applets have recently been deprecated and the program will not run correctly if forced to run in Java SE 12.

Please feel free to critisize my code! I'm always looking to improve :)

New things I learned from this project: 
1. Unit Testing
2. Overloading
3. Applet Intricacies
4. Advanced Collision Theory
