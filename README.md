Pong for PCC

Summer internship application

Pong is one of the oldest computer games. This is my attempt at recreating it with a retro theme.
The game is self-explanatory and I have heavily annoted the code. 

Please feel free to critisize it! I'm always looking to learn :)

New things I learned from this project: 
-Unit Testing
-Overloading
-Applet Intricacies
-Advanced Collision Theory
